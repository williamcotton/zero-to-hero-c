# Zero to Deep Learning

This project contains code for a neural network implementation in C. It includes functions for plotting mathematical functions, as well as implementations of neural network components such as neurons, layers, and multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs).

## Dependencies

This project requires the following dependencies:

- `gnuplot`: for plotting mathematical functions
- `leaks`: for detecting memory leaks (optional)

## Building

To build the project, run the following command:

```
make clean && make
```

This will generate an executable file named `main` in the `build` directory.

## Usage

To run the program, simply execute the `main` executable:

```
make run
```

This will run several examples of neural network components, including plotting mathematical functions, creating and calling neurons, layers, and MLPs, and training an MLP.
